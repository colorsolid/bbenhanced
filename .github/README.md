Event script and talk script source files with comments.

Event scripts are decompiled into MattScript using DarkScript3.

Talk scripts are decompiled into Python using esdtool. Internally for lamps, I have two single scripts that I edit, one for non-chalice dungeon lamps and one for chalice dungeon lamps. These files have placeholders that are replaced by a script that generates the individual lamp files. I plan to include these files and tools in this repository eventually.
